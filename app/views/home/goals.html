<h3 style="padding-left: 20px">Steve, Anthony - Why did you decide to build Solitaire?</h3>

    <dt>So what we are actually building here?</dt>
    <dd>
        <div style="padding-left: 25px;">
            <p>
                We are attempting to create a data broker called <span style="font-weight: bold;">ClinkWorks-Platform</span>
                <br />
                that is as close to Java SE compliant as we can make it without adding any strict learning curves
                in any of the given supported technologies.
            </p>
            <p>
                One of the big things I felt as a new developer in the enterprise world is just how many different xml configuration files
                you were required to learn at a very quick pace. Xml files for conifguring databases, xml files for identifying constructors.
                xml files for this that and the other.
                <p>Modern application development tooling is also so difficult to learn since you are never exposed to it in the achedemic world.
                So we decided to host a full fledged application stack including a CI server, multiple enviroment configurations for the build, and all that fun stuff.</p>
                <h4>The reason for it all</h4>
                <p style="font-weight: bold;">We want to deliver a full fledged playground for any hobbiest at any level to learn complex java skills and knowledge without alot of learning curve time</p>
            </p>
            <p>
                We really want to deliver developers creating rest API's using the ClinkWorks-Platform, easy means to create their own applications with out of the box support for valuable development techniques and education about API design.
            </p>
            <p>
                The idea is that it is possible to create a simple system with minimum viable product design with modular service based architecture at the for front of our api choices.
                <br />Taking this approach with strict test driven development with a focus on a service based architecture.
            </p>

    </dd>
    <dt>The features we hope to include in the overall platform are:</dt>
    <dd>
        <ul>
            <li>No XML configuration beyond a few simple POM's and a very trivial web.xml file</li>
            <li>No complex wiring of common services</li>
            <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Fully testable, fully tested</span>
                <ul>
                    <li>Easy unit testability</li>
                    <li>Configurability of "Test Environments"</li>
                    <li>Separation between system integration tests and external integration tests</li>
                    <li>Easy configuration of complex test scenarios</li>
                    <li>Easy configuration of complex system integration scenarios</li>
                    <li>Custom REST test framework</li>
                    <li>Custom system integration test runner</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Complete separation between internal ClinkWorks API and consumers (including internal)</li>
            <li>Out of the box polygot database support</li>
            <li>Generated UI using a combination of LowDash Node.JS and Angular.$resource</li>
            <li>Annotation based event API</li>
            <li>Annotation based business rule engine</li>
            <li>Annotation based API security administration</li>
        </ul>

    <dt>Why did we go down the path of building solitaire</dt>
    <dd>
        <p>
        <p>For both Steve and I, we wanted to see if we can build a solid API for implementing ... something...</p>
        <p>We experimented with several pretty neat ideas, and decided on the features we needed so support.</p>
        <p>Once we had the feature list, the rest fell into place quite nicely.</p>
        <p>
            The first thing we did was decide what technologies we needed to support as API providers
            and we needed to decided exactly how we were going to treat the api as far as testing.
        </p>
        <p>The next step we took was evaluate early on how we were going to support the test piramid</p>
        <p>After a few months of research and building prototypes we settled on the current technology suite we are are currently supporting with v.0.0.1 - SNAPSHOT of  the solitaire rest api</p>
        <p>
        <p>After that, we dove into learning the typical application stack for javascript developers.</p>
        <p>
            Steve is a new Developer, and ive never written front end javascript. So we had a huge learning curve to overcome when it came to the UI
            luckly due to previous Node.JS experience and AngularJS' amazing documentation, we decided on the front end api approach.
        </p>
        <p>
            So for a few months, Steve and I spent time learning and prototyping out these various technologies and decided it was
            time to apply our knowledge and start building this platform.
